Assumes foundation in AI/ML and basic robotics concepts. Primary Focus: Creating a production-ready, implementation-driven textbook that delivers on the promise of \"AI Systems in the Physical World\" through hands-on modules using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA integration. Core Success Criteria: Module Completion: All 4 modules must have fully implementable tutorials with working code Hardware Transparency: Clear guidance on required computational resources (RTX workstations, Jetson kits, robots) with budget alternatives Capstone Deliverable: Complete, step-by-step guide to building the \"Autonomous Humanoid\" that responds to voice commands, plans, navigates, and manipulates Academic Rigor: Peer-reviewed citations for all theoretical concepts while maintaining practical focus Deployment Ready: All content must generate a aining Hardware-accelerated VSLAM implementation with RealSense data Nav2 configuration for bipedal path planning (dynamic stability considerations) Deliverable: Object detection and navigation stack running in Isaac Sim Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Whisper integration for voice command processing in ROS 2 LLM prompt engineering for task decomposition (\"Clean the room\" -> ROS action sequence) Multi-modal fusion: Vision grounding with language instructions Capstone integration: End-to-end pipeline from voice to physical action Deliverable: Full VLA system where simulated robot executes complex natural language commands Hardware Section Requirements: Workstation Specifications: Exact RTX GPU requirements with VRAM calculations for different scene comfunctional Docusaurus site deployable to GitHub Pages Module Specifications: Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Complete ROS 2 Humble installation guide for Ubuntu 22.04 rclpy Python agent development with 5+ working examples URDF tutorials for humanoid robots (at least 2 different models) ROS 2 controllers for bipedal motion with parameter tuning Deliverable: Students can create a ROS 2 package that controls a simulated humanoid joint Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Gazebo world building with physics properties (gravity, friction, collisions) URDF-to-SDF conversion for high-fidelity simulation Sensor simulation: LiDAR point cloud generation, RGB-D camera data streams, IMU noise models Unity integration pipeline for human-robot interaction scenes Deliverable: Complete simulated apartment environment with interactive objects Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) Isaac Sim Omniverse deployment on RTX workstations Synthetic data generation pipeline for perception trplexities Jetson Deployment Guide: Flashing JetPack, optimizing ROS 2 nodes for edge compute Sensor Configuration: RealSense D435i calibration, LiDAR integration, IMU filtering Robot Options: Unitree Go2 vs. G1 vs. budget alternatives with ROS 2 driver setup Cloud Alternative: AWS g5/g6 instance setup with latency mitigation strategies Structural Requirements: Chapter Format: Learning objectives -> theory -> implementation -> exercises -> references Code Standards: All code must be tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble Visual Elements: System architecture diagrams, hardware connection schematics, data flow charts Assessment Integration: ROS package rubrics, simulation evaluation metrics, capstone grading criteria Progression: Linear build from Week 1-13 matching course schedule Technical Constraints: Platform: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as primary OS (with Windows/macOS compatibility notes) Software Versions: ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo 11, Unity 2022 LTS, Isaac Sim 2023.1+ Word Count: 30,000-40,000 words (textbook length) Sources: Minimum 40 references (60%% peer-reviewed robotics conferences: ICRA, IROS, RSS) Timeline: Content generation complete in 4 weeks Quality Gates: Code Verification: Every code snippet must compile and run in described environment Hardware Validation: All specifications must match commercially available components Pedagogical Flow: Each chapter\'s learning objectives must be demonstrably achievable Capstone Completeness: Final project must be buildable within 20 hours following instructions Cloud/On-Prem Parity: Tutorials must work in both environments with noted adjustments Explicitly Not Included: Basic AI/ML theory (assumes prerequisite knowledge) Non-humanoid robotics (except where applicable for budget alternatives) Proprietary software without academic licenses Hardware fabrication/mechanical design Extensive ethical discussions (brief safety section only) Historical robotics timeline Deployment Requirements: Docusaurus Structure: Proper sidebar navigation, search functionality, mobile responsiveness GitHub Pages: Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions Code Hosting: GitHub repository with complete example packages Media Assets: Optimized images, diagrams, and reference files Instructor Resources: Slide templates, assignment sheets, solution guides (separate section) Success Metrics: Instructor can directly adopt textbook for 13-week quarter without supplementary materials Students with described hardware can complete all modules successfully Cloud-only students can achieve 80%% of learning objectives Capstone project completion rate >90%% following instructions Zero \"it depends\" or vague implementation guidance Validation Protocol: Before final delivery, the textbook must pass: Technical accuracy review by robotics PhD candidate Pedagogical review by experienced robotics instructor Implementation test by novice following instructions exactly Hardware compatibility check across described configurations Docusaurus build and deployment verification This spec ensures your textbook will be a turnkey solution for teaching Physical AI with humanoid robotics, bridging the critical gap between digital AI and physical embodiment with practical, working implementations." -Number 1 -ShortName "physical-ai-robotics-textbook"
